# Code-Snip
The project is born for the "web technologies" exam at the University of Naples Parthenope.

HOW TO RUN:
To run the web app locally, follow these instructions:
1. Pull the project and install the required modules (requirements.txt); PyCharm will automatically detect them and ask you to install.
2. Install the docker image (docker load -i <path to copied image file>) and run it.
3. Run the project using the python interpreter (on Pycharm simply run).
4. Open your browser in localhost.
5. Enjoy!

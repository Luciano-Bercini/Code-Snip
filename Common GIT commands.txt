git clone "URL" -> clones the repository on your local machine.
git status -> shows the status of your local repository (branch/modified or added files, etc...)

git add 'File name' -> to use in case you added a local file in your local repository. Use "git add -A" to add all.
git commit -a -m "my custom message" -> commits the changes to your local repo (-a all changes, -m message)
git push origin main -> pushes to the github remote repository (default origin), to the main branch.
git pull origin main -> same as above, but pulls instead of pushing.
